# near_metabuild_3
We are a team of 3 wanting to build bridges between Functionland and Near Protocol.
why? both Near Protocol and Functionland  (Fx.land) care about javascript developers and want to ensure they have a a solid footing in web3 and that they are properly compensated for the work that they do to make the world a better place. 
Our intial idea ( thank-you Juan Benet for originally seeding this idea at  Livepeer/Protocol Labs event) is to create a p2p, web3 stock photography dApp
People can store their photos in Filecoin and or on their Fx BLox ( Functionland) and then retrieve and sell the photos to others upon request in Near Token, $Fil and next quarter, $FuLA
Wish us luck and join us if you wish!
Kate, Jainam and Sushmit
